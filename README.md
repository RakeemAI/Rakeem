<h1 style="color:#3498db;">Project Overview</h1>

Rakeem is an intelligent financial agent that serves medium and emerging businesses in Saudi Arabia and integrates three main components:

1. <strong style="color:#3498db;">Core Financial Analysis Model</strong>  
   Analyzes company financial data (from Excel/CSV files) using Python libraries to provide accurate calculations of profitability, cash flow, Zakat, and taxes.

2. <strong style="color:#3498db;">Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Prediction</strong>  
   Utilizes a RAG system (with a FAISS index) for precise retrieval of legal and financial data from ZATCA documents, along with Holt models to provide reliable financial forecasts for future business performance.

3. <strong style="color:#3498db;">Large Language Model Integration (LLM Integration)</strong>  
   Employs large language models (LLMs) to connect digital analysis and legal data retrieval, delivering clear explanations and practical recommendations in Arabic.

<h2 style="color:#3498db;">What “Rakeem” Means</h2>

“Rakeem” is an authentic Arabic name that refers to the act of accumulating and stacking things tightly on top of each other, giving them stability and strength—like a mountain. We chose this name because our platform collects knowledge and data in an organized and precise way, providing a reliable basis of intelligence and analysis that supports decision-making and helps grow medium and emerging businesses.

<h2 style="color:#3498db;">User Journey through Rakeem Agent</h2>

The Rakeem system is designed to simplify financial management through three main interconnected stages:

### Stage 1: Instant Data Analysis
- **Action:** The user uploads the financial file (Excel/CSV) to the system.  
- **System:** The Core Financial Analysis Model (Python) is activated.  
- **Outcome:** Immediate display of profitability, cash flow, Zakat, and Taxes calculations on the Dashboard, in addition to Prediction results.

### Stage 2: AI-Augmented Consultation
- **Action:** The user asks a financial or regulatory question in Arabic.  
- **System:** The RAG system (using FAISS) retrieves rules from ZATCA documents, and the LLM generates the response.  
- **Outcome:** A clear answer that is reliably grounded and supported by official legal information.

### Stage 3: Documentation and Strategic Export
- **Action:** The user clicks the “Generate Report” button located on the Dashboard.  
- **System:** The system creates a file compiling the analysis, predictions, and automated recommendations.  
- **Outcome:** A final, documented financial report (PDF) ready for decision-making or presentation.

<h2 style="color:#3498db;">Expected Questions about Rakeem</h2>

### 1. What distinguishes Rakeem from current market offerings?
There is currently no integrated Intelligent Agent combining four essential features tailored for the Saudi market: direct financial analysis of user data, reliable financial prediction, chatbot consultation, and certified report generation. Our competitive edge lies in:  

- **Integrated Regulatory Compliance:** Using the RAG system fed with official ZATCA documents ensures every recommendation or calculation (like Zakat and Tax) is legally compliant.  
- **Language and Customization:** Delivering the entire service, analysis, and recommendations in high-quality Arabic, specifically designed for the needs of Saudi SMEs.

### 2. How can we trust the project and entrust it with our financial data?
Trust in Rakeem is built on technical security and complete data transparency:  

- **Privacy Guarantee (No Training):** Financial files (Excel/CSV) are analyzed in a secure environment, ensuring this data is not used to train any general LLMs, thus preventing leakage of sensitive information.  
- **Explainable and Reliable Results:** Numerical results are calculated using a transparent and tested Python analytical model. Legal answers are supported by the RAG system, enabling the agent to cite the official ZATCA source for full credibility and transparency.

<h2 style="color:#3498db;">Project Objectives</h2>

Rakeem's objectives are focused on achieving technical maturity (short-term) and strategic expansion (long-term):

### I. Short-Term Objectives (Within the Bootcamp / MVP Phase)
- **Prove Technical Feasibility (POC):** Fully activate the functional integration between the Financial Analysis Model (Python) and the RAG-LLM system within a single cycle.  
- **Achieve Compliance Accuracy:** Ensure an accuracy rate of at least 95% in retrieving and interpreting ZATCA regulatory rules.  
- **Market Readiness:** Launch the user interface (MVP) with instant analysis features, core prediction, and initial report generation.

### II. Long-Term Objectives (Post-Bootcamp / Expansion)
- **Expand Customer Base:** Gradually expand the target audience to include Large Enterprises and Individuals, in addition to SMEs.  
- **Regional Leadership:** Expand the knowledge base of the RAG system to cover regulations from other regulatory bodies, establishing Rakeem as an integrated legal business consultant.  
- **Deepen Predictive Intelligence:** Develop the models to provide Prescriptive Analytics that offers specific financial actions and business scenario simulations (What-if Analysis).

<h2 style="color:#3498db;">Execution Plan & Methodology</h2>

We adopted a Collaborative Learning methodology throughout the project execution, where all team members worked jointly on every task. This ensured the acquisition of integrated expertise across all development aspects. Approximately 90% of this plan has been successfully completed, following the sequence below:

### Key Execution Steps

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**  
   - **Operational Data:** Securing and preparing a set of hypothetical operational financial data for SMEs (Excel/CSV) for analysis and calculation purposes.  
   - **Knowledge Data:** Collecting and cleaning official ZATCA regulatory documents to establish the local legal knowledge base.

2. **Developing the Financial Engine and RAG System**  
   - Designing the Python Financial Engine to execute precise equations for calculating Profitability, Cash Flow, Zakat, and Taxes.  
   - Building the highly efficient retrieval index using the FAISS library to enable rapid access to ZATCA rules.

3. **Integrating the Large Language Model and Chatbot Activation**  
   - Developing the RAG module to link user inquiries in Arabic with the retrieved legal rules (FAISS).  
   - Instructing the Large Language Model (LLM) to combine numerical analysis with legal interpretation in a clear and professional manner.

4. **Forecasting and Strategic Recommendations**  
   - Building and training the Prediction models (Holt) for future financial performance.  
   - Developing algorithms to provide automated recommendations based on analysis, forecasting, and legal compliance results.

5. **Interface Design and Report Generation**  
   - Developing the final graphical user interface (Dashboard) using Streamlit.  
   - Activating the function to generate comprehensive, downloadable PDF reports that compile all analytical and predictive outputs.

6. **System Testing and Necessary Enhancements**  
   - Conducting extensive System Testing and User Acceptance Testing for the interface to ensure accuracy and performance.  
   - Applying necessary improvements to model accuracy and response speed in preparation for launch.
