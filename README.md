# Rakeem: AI-powered Arabic Financial Assistant

Project Overview
​Rakeem is an intelligent financial agent that serves medium and emerging businesses in Saudi Arabia and integrates three main components:
​Core Financial Analysis Model: Analyzes company financial data (from Excel/CSV files) using Python libraries to provide accurate calculations of profitability, cash flow, Zakat, and taxes.
​Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Prediction: Utilizes a RAG system (with a FAISS index) for precise retrieval of legal and financial data from ZATCA documents, along with Holt models to provide reliable financial forecasts for future business performance.
​Large Language Model Integration (LLM Integration): Employs large language models (LLMs) to connect digital analysis and legal data retrieval, delivering clear explanations and practical recommendations in Arabic.
​Additional Features:
​Interactive Chatbot: Allows users to ask financial questions directly and receive accurate, supported answers.
​Financial Report Generation: Users can download comprehensive financial reports (PDF) ready for printing or presentation.

​What “Rakeem” Means
​“Rakeem” is an authentic Arabic name that refers to the act of accumulating and stacking things tightly on top of each other, giving them stability and strength—like a mountain. We chose this name because our platform collects knowledge and data in an organized and precise way, providing a reliable basis of intelligence and analysis that supports decision-making and helps grow medium and emerging businesses.
​User Journey through Rakeem Agent
​The Rakeem system is designed to simplify financial management through three main interconnected stages:
​Stage 1: Instant Data Analysis
​Action: The user uploads the financial file (Excel/CSV) to the system.
​System: The Core Financial Analysis Model (Python) is activated.
​Outcome: Immediate display of profitability, cash flow, Zakat, and Taxes calculations on the Dashboard, in addition to Prediction results.
​Stage 2: AI-Augmented Consultation
​Action: The user asks a financial or regulatory question in Arabic.
​System: The RAG system (using FAISS) retrieves rules from ZATCA documents, and the LLM generates the response.
​Outcome: A clear answer that is reliably grounded and supported by official legal information.
​Stage 3: Documentation and Strategic Export
​Action: The user clicks the “Generate Report” button located on the Dashboard.
​System: The system creates a file compiling the analysis, predictions, and automated recommendations.
​Outcome: A final, documented financial report (PDF) ready for decision-making or presentation.
​Expected Questions about Rakeem
​1. What distinguishes Rakeem from current market offerings?
​There is currently no integrated Intelligent Agent combining four essential features tailored for the Saudi market: direct financial analysis of user data, reliable financial prediction, chatbot consultation, and certified report generation. Our competitive edge lies in:
​Integrated Regulatory Compliance: Using the RAG system fed with official ZATCA documents ensures every recommendation or calculation (like Zakat and Tax) is legally compliant, not just a general analysis.
​Language and Customization: Delivering the entire service, analysis, and recommendations in high-quality Arabic, specifically designed for the needs of Saudi SMEs.
​2. How can we trust the project and entrust it with our financial data?
​Trust in Rakeem is built on technical security and complete data transparency:
​Privacy Guarantee (No Training): Financial files (Excel/CSV) are analyzed in a secure environment, ensuring this data is not used to train any general Large Language Models (LLMs), thus preventing the leakage of sensitive information.
​Explainable and Reliable Results: Numerical results are calculated using a transparent and tested Python analytical model. Legal answers are supported by the RAG system, enabling the agent to cite the official ZATCA source for full credibility and transparency.
​Project Objectives
​Rakeem's objectives are focused on achieving technical maturity (short-term) and strategic expansion (long-term):
​I. Short-Term Objectives (Within the Bootcamp / MVP Phase)
​Prove Technical Feasibility (POC): Fully activate the functional integration between the Financial Analysis Model (Python) and the RAG-LLM system within a single cycle.
​Achieve Compliance Accuracy: Ensure an accuracy rate of at least 95% in retrieving and interpreting ZATCA regulatory rules.
​Market Readiness: Launch the user interface (MVP) with instant analysis features, core prediction, and initial report generation.
​II. Long-Term Objectives (Post-Bootcamp / Expansion)
​Expand Customer Base: Gradually expand the target audience to include Large Enterprises and Individuals, in addition to SMEs.
​Regional Leadership: Expand the knowledge base of the RAG system to cover regulations from other regulatory bodies, establishing Rakeem as an integrated legal business consultant.
​Deepen Predictive Intelligence: Develop the models to provide Prescriptive Analytics that offers specific financial actions and business scenario simulations (What-if Analysis).
​Execution Plan & Methodology
​We adopted a Collaborative Learning methodology throughout the project execution, where all team members worked jointly on every task. This ensured the acquisition of integrated expertise across all development aspects. We are proud that approximately 90% of this plan has been successfully completed, following the sequence below:
​Key Execution Steps:
​Data Collection and Preparation:
​Operational Data: Securing and preparing a set of hypothetical operational financial data for SMEs (Excel/CSV) for analysis and calculation purposes.
​Knowledge Data: Collecting and cleaning official ZATCA regulatory documents to establish the local legal knowledge base.
​Developing the Financial Engine and RAG System:
​Designing the Python Financial Engine to execute precise equations for calculating Profitability, Cash Flow, Zakat, and Taxes.
​Building the highly efficient retrieval index using the FAISS library to enable rapid access to ZATCA rules.
​Integrating the Large Language Model and Chatbot Activation:
​Developing the RAG module to link user inquiries in Arabic with the retrieved legal rules (FAISS).
​Instructing the Large Language Model (LLM) to combine numerical analysis with legal interpretation in a clear and professional manner.
​Forecasting and Strategic Recommendations:
​Building and training the Prediction models (Holt) for future financial performance.
​Developing algorithms to provide automated recommendations based on analysis, forecasting, and legal compliance results.
​Interface Design and Report Generation:
​Developing the final graphical user interface (Dashboard) using Streamlit.
​Activating the function to generate comprehensive, downloadable PDF reports that compile all analytical and predictive outputs.
​System Testing and Necessary Enhancements:
​Conducting extensive System Testing and User Acceptance Testing for the interface to ensure accuracy and performance.
​Applying necessary improvements to model accuracy and response speed in preparation for launch.
